I hold bachelor’s degrees in Environmental Engineering and Energy and Environmental Policy from University of Delaware. After graduation, I worked as a Water Resources Modeler and Programmer based in Malvern, PA for Environmental Resources Management (ERM). At ERM, I worked on a variety of projects ranging from oil spill and drill cuttings modelling to coastal imagery-based shoreline studies. My daily activities included the coding, debugging and use of FORTRAN-based hydrodynamic modelling suite named GEMSS (Generalized Environmental Modeling System for Surfacewaters). Executing the model often demanded the use of cloud computing through AWS and Microsoft Azure. To meet the data cleaning and processing needs, I developed and executed scripts in Python (including ESRI ArcPy), R and UNIX command line to make our workflows more efficient. While in the industry, I also pursued my interests in sustainable development through the Micromaster’s Program in Data, Economics and Development Policy Program offered by MIT. Through attaining the Micromaster’s credential which focused on the social, economic and data challenges associated with addressing poverty, gender equality, education and the environment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
